<h1 align="center">Hey, u have come so far across, you deserve an easy one now !!!</h1>
<h3>A professor thinks of 2 consecutive numbers between 1 & 10 (both inclusive). Student "A" knows one number & "B" knows another.</h3>
<h3>while they chat in lunchtime, i hear them </h3>
<h4>A says: I do not know your number</h4>
<h4>B says: Neither do i know your number</h4>
<h4>A says: Now i know your number</h4>
<h3>You have to find the possible (pair of numbers) (A,B), if none of them are lying</h3>  
<!--Interesting???-->
<h3 class="img" align="center">Hint: Suppose the answer is (2,1),(7,6),(4,5),(2,3)<!--which is not correct by any means--> , You have to enter the next page's name as 21234576 (i.e. the pair sums in ascending order & pair order preserved)</h3>
